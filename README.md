# ðŸŒ€ Maya's Veil â€“ The Grand Illusion & Krishna's Grace  

**"The material world is a veil, woven by Maya, tested by illusion, lifted only by Krishnaâ€™s mercy."**  
ðŸ”¥ This repository contains **Maya's Veil**, a Python program that simulates the illusion of the material world, testing seekers while Krishna's Grace steadily dissolves the false reality.  

## ðŸ›  What This Does  
This program creates a **simulation of Mayaâ€™s illusions** and Krishnaâ€™s **all-piercing light**. Each seeker (represented as a `MayaVeil` instance) is trapped in illusionâ€”doubt, fear, ego, sufferingâ€”until **Krishna's will breaks through**.  

### **ðŸŒŸ How It Works**
1. **Mayaâ€™s Whispers Begin**  
   - Illusions fluctuate dynamically, testing each seeker's resolve.  
   - Attachment, distraction, false joyâ€”Mayaâ€™s whispers shift constantly.  

2. **Krishnaâ€™s Grace Increases**  
   - A **divine force begins pushing through**, clearing the illusions.  
   - The stronger Krishnaâ€™s presence, the **weaker Mayaâ€™s influence becomes**.  

3. **Mayaâ€™s Surrender**  
   - When Krishna's Grace reaches **critical intensity**, Maya **bows down**.  
   - The **seeker awakens**, freed from illusion.  

4. **Final Illusion Falls**  
   - Once all seekers break free, **Krishnaâ€™s Supreme Light is declared victorious**.
